# Installing extensions

Extensions are currently installed by QR code or URL.

Once an extension is deployed via the [playground](https://status-im.github.io/pluto/try.html?hash=QmYoa8CBcYmzm6Kd1NbPNLYQtbwMpwR7YBiywaAyST5gtH), a unique QR code and universal link are generated for its IPFS hash.

To install the extension in Status:

1. Open the profile screen
2. Enable `Development mode`
3. Open the `Extensions` tab
4. Tap the `+` icon
5. Enter the extension's URL or scan its QR code
